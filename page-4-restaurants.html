            <h4>My favorite places to eat</h4>
            <p>Eating out in East Village will present you with choice overload. Korean? Japanese? Georgian? Ukranian? Hawaiian? Mexican? Filipino? Italian? Greek? Basically anything you could ever want? East Village is New York in a culinary microcosm. Have fun. </p>

                <h3>Prune</h3>
                <p> Prune will forever have a special place in my heart, especially after reading the author's excellent memoir, <i>Blood, Bones, and Butter.</i> On one of my first visits to NYC, I enjoyed a ros&eacute soaked lunch while enjoying one of the best burgers of my life. They no longer do lunch, but they do provide an excellent brunch. I've tried nearly everything on the menu but keep coming back to the chickpeas with buttered egg.  How they butter and bread a poached egg is still a delicious mystery to me, one that I need to keep investigating over and over.</p>

                <h3>Momofuku Noodle Bar</h3>
                <p> This place is no secret but that doesn't make it less delectable. The buns are moist with a perfect balance of sweet and sour in the hoisin dressing the flavorful pork belly. The ramen delivers. And then there is the spicy noodles. Using semi-sweet chinese sausage to top toothsome noodles covered in a serious chili oil. The queues are long but there are plenty of bars nearby to wait it out. </p>

                <h3>Veselka</h3>
                <p> A 24/7 diner with endless borcht and pierogies sounds like a fantasy, but in NYC it's real. And it's wonderful. For casual brunch or 3am post-bar nosh, Veselka hits the spot with Ukranian classics including stuffed cabbage and smoked sausage. In an NY twist, they also offer the experimental peirogies (think salmon and cream cheese). A true NYC institution. </p>

                <h3>M&aacutel&agrave Project</h3>
                <p>M&aacutel&agrave Project introduces Chinese dry pot, a type of spicy stir-fry that combines the best of Sichuna flavor. "M&aacutel&agrave" refers to the tingly, numbing spice caused by sichuan peppercorns. This, combined with chili peper spice, is mouth watering. Choose your ingredients (I always include some lotus root) and wait for them to be trasnformed into an irresistable medley. </p>
